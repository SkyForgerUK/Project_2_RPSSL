### Fixed bugs
- __Logo not showing on the published page__
    - In the page header the path to the logo image started like - "/assets/..." so I changed it to "assets/..." and the issue was fixed
- __Thank you page background image overlapping the nav bar for screen sizes over 900px__
    - Created a new set of styling in "@media screen and (min-width: 900px)" to counter the issue - fixed
 ### Not fixed bugs
 - __Logo on screens below 900px does not respond to clicks - shortcut to Home page__
    - This bug will be fixed after project submission
